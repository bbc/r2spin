This document details the recordings and supplementary files for the Re-recorded Revised Speech Perception in Noise Test (R2SPIN). 

*L. Ward, C. Robinson, M. Paradis, K. Tucker and B. Shirley, “R2SPIN: Re-recording the Revised Speech Perception in Noise Test”, in Interspeech 2019, Graz, Austria, Sept, 2019.*

Reasons for re-recording the corpus, methodology used and validation undertaken are outlined in the above paper. The remainder of this README details the files, their formats and how they may be used. 
We would like to acknowledge the Department of Speech & Hearing Science at the University of Illinois who hold the license for the original R-SPIN recordings for their permission to re-record them. 

### Audio Recordings 

The .wav files for the R2SPIN are hosted at:
#### [http://data.bbcarp.org.uk/r2spin/](http://data.bbcarp.org.uk/r2spin/) 

The naming convention for these files is:
 
List[#]_[SpeakerGender]_[SNR].wav

Three versions of the new speech recordings are presented, with speech at 0dB, -4dB and -6dB. Each sentence has been normalised to -23 LUFs, as detailed in the paper, before setting the overall level.  Each have the numbers included in the audio file. -4dB is the level used for the validation in the paper and yields an approximate speech reception threshold of 50% for the male speaker. -6dB was used for a small pilot in the paper and yields and approximate speech reception threshold of 50% for the female speaker. These sentences have their keyword align with the timing of the keyword in the original RSPIN recording for ease of comparison with the original. The validation data given in the paper only holds for these timings when used with the original RSPIN multi-talker noise. 

A separate track with the numbers only is also provided.
